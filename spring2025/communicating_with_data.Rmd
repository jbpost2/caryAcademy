# Why Data Vis?

- Numbers are hard for people...

- A picture is worth a thousand words

- Caveat! Visual must be clear and purposeful

# How to Summarize Data?

- Depends on data type:  

    + Categorical (Qualitative) variable - entries are a label or attribute   
    + Numeric (Quantitative) variable - entries are a numerical value where math can be performed

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/variableTypes.png")
```

What do we generally look to describe?

- Try to describe the distribution or a summary of that distribution

    + Often across groups for comparison!

# Best Practices

[Urban Institute](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/) has great tips!

- Things to avoid

    + Nonzero baselines on bar charts
    + Can use percent change or difference as an alternative

- Example: [Docket Management](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Docket Change

---

# Best Practices

[Urban Institute](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/) has great tips!

- Things to avoid

    + Dual axis charts are bad
    + Use multiple graphs next to each other

- Example: [Repeat Involvement](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Overview


---

# Best Practices

[Urban Institute](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/) has great tips!

- Things to avoid

    + Pie charts with too many slices are bad. 
    + Keep the overall number of slices in pie charts to fewer than 5
    + Avoid too many categories
    + Keep the number of categories in any graph to fewer than seven
    + Continuums are ok

- Example: [County Profiles](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Population -> Urban-Rural Map
- Example: [Population Map](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Population -> Population Map


---

# Recommendations

Keep it simple

- Graph should speak for itself!
- Consider what you want your reader to come away with
- Call out important items

- Example: [County Profiles](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Economy -> Income (choose Ashe)


---

# Recommendations

Create small multiples

- Create a series of smaller graphs to break a complex graph into smaller pieces 
- Can create sense of movement or time

- Example: [Cost of Engagement Ring](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/13/upshot/engagement-rings-cost-two-weeks-pay.html)


---

# Recommendations

Provide a baseline or reference when possible

- Not needed if percent change or difference is graphed
- Useful to give context

- Example: [Pretrial Failures](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Court Non-Appearance -> Race (choose a county)
- Example: [Global Temperature](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-global-temperature-change.html)


---

# Recommendation

Use active, concise titles

- Consider “Labor Force Participation Rate, Men and Women, 1950–2019,” vs “The Labor Force Participation Rate Has Declined for Men and Increased for Women.” 

- Subtitles can be used to denote specifics about the data, such as time periods, frequency, units, or geography.

- Example: [Segregation in Low-Wage Workforce](https://www.workrisenetwork.org/features/segregation-low-wage-workforce)


---

# Recommendation

When possible, avoid using legends and instead directly label the data on the graph. 

Mark outliers that are significantly different than others.

- Example: [Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-bus-ridership-in-metropolitan-areas.html)

Generally, find visuals that speak to you!

- Many good examples [at the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/learning/over-60-new-york-times-graphs-for-students-to-analyze.html) and [at the Urban Institute (data tools)](https://www.urban.org/stories-data-tools-and-blogs)

# Questions Around Census Data

.pull-left[
Reintroduce it

- Discuss past ethical practices around data anonymity

Go through the online interface

- Develop a Q of interest based on the data we have

    - What data answers this question?

    - What is the key point to get across?
    
    - Sketch out what a visual might look like
