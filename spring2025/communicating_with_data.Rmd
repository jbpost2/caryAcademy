- Numbers are hard for people...

# How to Summarize Data?

- Depends on data type:  

    + Categorical (Qualitative) variable - entries are a label or attribute   
    + Numeric (Quantitative) variable - entries are a numerical value where math can be performed

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/variableTypes.png")
```

What do we generally look to describe?

- Try to describe the distribution or a summary of that distribution

    + Often across groups for comparison!

# Best Practices

[Urban Institute](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/) has great tips!

- Things to avoid

    + Nonzero baselines on bar charts
    + Can use percent change or difference as an alternative

- Example: [Docket Management](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Docket Change

---

# Best Practices

[Urban Institute](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/) has great tips!

- Things to avoid

    + Dual axis charts are bad
    + Use multiple graphs next to each other

- Example: [Repeat Involvement](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Overview


---

# Best Practices

[Urban Institute](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/) has great tips!

- Things to avoid

    + Pie charts with too many slices are bad. 
    + Keep the overall number of slices in pie charts to fewer than 5
    + Avoid too many categories
    + Keep the number of categories in any graph to fewer than seven
    + Continuums are ok

- Example: [County Profiles](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Population -> Urban-Rural Map
- Example: [Population Map](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Population -> Population Map


---

# Recommendation

Keep it simple

- Graph should speak for itself!
- Consider what you want your reader to come away with
- Call out important items

- Example: [County Profiles](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Economy -> Income (choose Ashe)


---

# Recommendation

Create small multiples

- Create a series of smaller graphs to break a complex graph into smaller pieces 
- Can create sense of movement or time

- Example: [Cost of Engagement Ring](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/13/upshot/engagement-rings-cost-two-weeks-pay.html)


---

# Recommendation

Provide a baseline or reference when possible

- Not needed if percent change or difference is graphed
- Useful to give context

- Example: [Pretrial Failures](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/) -> Court Non-Appearance -> Race (choose a county)
- Example: [Global Temperature](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-global-temperature-change.html)


---

# Recommendation

Use active, concise titles

- Consider “Labor Force Participation Rate, Men and Women, 1950–2019,” vs “The Labor Force Participation Rate Has Declined for Men and Increased for Women.” 

- Subtitles can be used to denote specifics about the data, such as time periods, frequency, units, or geography.

- Example: [Segregation in Low-Wage Workforce](https://www.workrisenetwork.org/features/segregation-low-wage-workforce)


---

# Recommendation

When possible, avoid using legends and instead directly label the data on the graph. 

Mark outliers that are significantly different than others.

- Example: [Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-bus-ridership-in-metropolitan-areas.html)

.pull-right[
Ethically, data is private!

- 70's used a threshold to only show certain tables
- 90's used swapping of tracts
- Now, noise injection is used (3 ways). One example: 
    
    + At US level, covert to summary form. Noise added to each query.
    + Post processing done to remove any negatives other invalid values
    + Then state level is done with constraints that the aggregation must meet the US level data...
    + Then county, tract, block group, block!

# Available Data

- Online interface exists but is a bit clunky...

    + Can get data for multiple years, compare states, counties, etc.

# `tidycensus` Package

`tidycensus` package allows for easy pulling of census data into R!


```{r}
library(tidycensus)
my_key <- "e267f117801b2ef741e54620602b0903c5f4d3c8"
students_data <- get_acs(variables = "B14002_001E", 
        geography = "county", 
        geometry = TRUE,
        survey = "acs5",
        show_call = TRUE, 
        state = "NC",
        year = 2023,
        key = my_key)
```

---

# `tidycensus` Package

```{r}
students_data
```

---

# `tidycensus` Package

```{r, out.height="400px"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(students_data, aes(y = estimate, x = variable)) + geom_boxplot()
```

---

# `tidycensus` Package

```{r}
students_data_SC <- get_acs(variables = "B14002_001E", geography = "county", geometry = TRUE,
        survey = "acs5", state = "SC", year = 2023, key = my_key)
library(dplyr)
students_data <- students_data |>
  mutate(state = "NC") 
students_data_SC <- students_data_SC |>
  mutate(state = "SC")
students <- rbind(students_data, students_data_SC)
```


---

# `tidycensus` Package

students_data |> 
  mapview::mapview(zcol = "estimate", layer.name = "# of Students (9-12th grade)")
```


---

# `tidycensus` Package

Census doesn't give out individual data - some data will be hidden with the `acs` data

- `pums` allows for pseudo individual level data!

```{r}
school_micro <- get_pums(
  variables = "SCH", 
  state = "NC",
  year = 2023,
  show_call = TRUE,
  survey = "acs1",
  key = my_key
  )
school_micro
```

---

# `tidycensus` Package

Must use weights here though!

```{r}
sum(school_micro$PWGTP)
```

---

# `tidycensus` Package

`ggplot()` has a `weight` argument

```{r, out.height="325px"}
school_micro |> 
  mutate(school = factor(SCH, levels = c("0", "1", "2", "3"), 
                         labels = c("< 3yrs old", "No school",
                                    "Public",  "Private"))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = school, weight = PWGTP)) + geom_bar() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```


---

# Ok, go?

`View(pums_variables)` useful
